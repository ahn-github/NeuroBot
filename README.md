# NeuroBot
This is open source robot with a deep neural network.
Deep Neural Network can be configured by a file content.

Training Data are in "training.txt".

Topology is in "topology.txt".

Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9_z_reCno

Android App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyberpunktech.RobotController.app

If the content of "weights.txt" file is deleted, the neural network automatically retrain itself again.
If the number of weights in the weights.txt file matches with topology, the Neural Network just loads them, and runs.
